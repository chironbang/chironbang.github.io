I am a PhD Candidate in Computer Science at [Florida Atlantic University](https://www.fau.edu) (FAU). My interest spans on Dynamic System Modelling using Deep Learning approaches, Marine Animal sound detection and classification using Machine learning.

Prior to joining FAU, I occupied a System and Network Administrator role at [Africa Data Center](https://www.adac.cm/) (Professional Internship). I  hold a Master degree in Telecommunications Engineering from the National Advanced School of Engineering of Yaounde.

## Realization of a productivity tool to support information system security auditors    
**March-July 2020**

In the process of preparing and conducting security audits in an organization, the auditing team has to
deal with a huge amount of working papers (security policy, previous audit reports, organisation chart,
network and application architecture etc...) which need to be classified, distributed amongst the team
members, analyzed etc. They also need to work together on the same documents and communicate with
each other while conducting an audit. So we developped a web platform (using the Django framework
in back-end and Bootstrap in front-end) which gives various features:
- creation of an audit project;
- creation, modification of a document and an audit report;
- transcription of a scanned document to a text file;
- a discussion forum.

## Simulation of the saccadic eye movement
**September 2019-January 2020**

The aim of this project was to simulate (using Matlab and Simulink) different type of saccades (simple
ones { from 0 to 10◦ for instance, successive ones {from 0 to 10, 10 to 20◦). To carry out this project,
we have done the following tasks:
- Presentation of the eye and the muscles implicated in saccades;
- Making a short review of the literature concerning the modelling of an eye and the surrounding
muscles involved in the saccadic movement, hence we made an appropriate model choice;
- Breaking down the system into a linear system then represent in using Simulink blocks;
- Designing a PID Controller for the system;
- Simulating the saccades in an open-loop no feedback system and then with the PID controller;
- Comparing and commenting using resulting data and graphs.

## Platform for Electrical Default Detection
**September 2019**
After gathering and storing all the data which describes the state of an electrical line in the database
of our platform (mainly the phase intensities and tensions) we use an algorithm which permits to determine if there is a fault and if so, which type of fault it is; finally we generate a report for the state
of this electrical line. The front-end was mostly coded using the well-known Bootstrap framework and
the back-end was coded using the python Django framework.
